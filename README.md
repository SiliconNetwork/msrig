# msrig
A Chrome Extension that lets you earn Microsoft Rewards points without using Edge as your default browser or Bing as your default search engine.

##Installation

1. Clone/download this repo and extract it.
2. If you are installing this on Chromium-based browsers, go to chrome://extensions/ and enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch at the top right corner.
3. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the folder you extracted this repo to (the folder should be named msrig if you didn't extract it to another folder).

##Does It Work?
Try firing up a search, and check the tabs of your browser. You should also verify that you are earning points.

##Is This A Virus Or A Tracker?
No. The code is open source, and you can verify it does not track, collect, or sell your browsing history to anyone except Bing, because it sends your browsing history to Bing :).

##TOS
This extension does violate the TOS, and by using this extension I am not responsible if this gets your Microsoft Rewards account suspended. I am not encouraging you to use this in any way.

THIS PROJECT IS IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH MICROSOFT OR GOOGLE.
